# HTML, CSS, and Git Refactor

## Description

this weeks task simulates an on the job ticket that has starter code that needs to be modified. I will need to refactor the code without changing what it does. With this refactor I will be implementing accessibility standards to help people with disabilities that use screen readers or braille keyboards using the alt tag. I found semantic elements such as <footer>, <class>, and <header>.
