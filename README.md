# HTML, CSS, and Git Refactor

## Description

this weeks task simulates an on the job ticket that has starter code that needs to be modified. I will need to refactor the code without changing what it does. With this refactor I will be implementing accessibility standards to help people with disabilities that use screen readers or braille keyboards using the alt tag. I found semantic elements such as footer, class, and header. An accessibility tag would be an alt tag. This alt tag gives your image a caption if it doesnt load right or if a person uses a screen reader.
